"### BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 205.251.192.0/23\n\n**Time of Anomaly Detection:** April 24, 2018, 11:05:00 (UTC)\n\n**Anomaly Type:** Unauthorized Route Announcement\n\n**Affected IP Prefixes:**  \n- 205.251.192.0/23\n- 205.251.192.0/24 (Sub-prefix)\n- 205.251.193.0/24 (Sub-prefix)\n\n**Related AS Numbers:**\n- AS10297: Associated with the unauthorized announcements for the sub-prefixes.\n- AS6939: Appears in the path towards the unauthorized sub-prefix announcements.\n\n**Background and Historical Paths:**\nHistorically, the routes to IP prefix 205.251.192.0/23 were observed consistently traversing through AS paths ending with AS16509, which is a well-known AS associated with Amazon. There were no records of sub-prefixes (/24) announced separately in historical data.\n\n**Behavior Before the Anomaly:**\nBefore the anomaly event, the AS paths for 205.251.192.0/23 were consistent with historical paths leading up to AS16509 from various collectors globally.\n\n**Behavior During and After the Anomaly:**\nDuring the anomaly event, a significant change occurred where two new sub-prefixes, 205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24, were observed being announced with AS10297 as the origin instead of being part of the larger /23 prefix under AS16509's control. This was seen in multiple collectors (e.g., rrc00, rrc03, rrc06) where the paths contained AS10297, indicating a possible misconfiguration or route leak involving AS10297.\n\nThe presence of AS6939 in these unauthorized paths suggests that AS6939 may have been unintentionally or maliciously used as a transit AS, supporting the propagation of these unauthorized announcements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis event is characterized by the announcement of more specific sub-prefixes (205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24) originating from AS10297, which is inconsistent with historical routing information. This suggests the possibility of a route hijack or misconfiguration event.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Contact the network operators of AS10297 and AS6939 to validate these prefixes' announcements and rectify if it was an error.\n2. Amazon's network operations (AS16509) should verify their routing policies and implement route filtering to prevent unauthorized sub-prefix advertisements.\n3. Continue to monitor BGP announcements for further discrepancies or unauthorized sub-prefix routing activities.\n\n**Note:** This report is based on the BGP data provided and might require additional validation with operational network teams of the ASes involved for a thorough resolution."
