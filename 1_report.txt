"**BGP Anomaly Report**\n\n**Event Summary:**\n\n- **Affected IP Prefix:** 104.244.42.0/24\n- **Date and Time of Anomaly Detection:** March 28, 2022, 12:05:00\n- **Anomaly Type:** Possible BGP Hijack or Misconfiguration\n- **Related Autonomous Systems (AS):** AS8359 and AS8342\n- **Affected Regions:** Multiple, as paths were seen through several different route collectors around the globe.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n**1. Background:**\nThe prefix 104.244.42.0/24 has historically been announced by AS13414. Before the event, AS paths contained consistent transit through well-known providers like AS2914, AS1299, and AS3356. There was no previous evidence of routing through AS8359 and AS8342 in the historical or recent data observed before the anomaly.\n\n**2. Observed Anomaly:**\n- **AS Path Insertion:** After the anomaly event started, there is a notable insertion of AS8359 and AS8342 in multiple AS paths to the target prefix 104.244.42.0/24. \n- **Widespread Impact:** This anomaly affected multiple BGP collectors such as rrc01, rrc03, and rrc10 from various geographical locations, showing paths containing AS8359 and AS8342 where these were not seen before.\n  \n**3. Impact on BGP:**\n- **Route Diversion:** The newly inserted ASes suggest a potential hijacking or misconfiguration event where traffic destined for the legitimate prefix might be redirected through AS8359 and AS8342, affecting the routing and performance.\n- **AS Path Changes:** Notable AS path changes indicating the appearance of AS8359 and AS8342 replacing or appending to stable paths that previously did not include these AS numbers.\n\n**4. Historical Context:**\n- **No Historical Presence:** Review of historical data showed no involvement of AS8359 and AS8342 in routes towards the prefix 104.244.42.0/24. \n- **Usual AS Paths:** Historically paths include consistent appearances of AS1299, AS2914, AS3356, and the prefix owner AS13414 without interference from these new ASes.\n\n**5. Conclusion and Recommendations:**\nThe sudden appearance and insertion of AS8359 and AS8342 in the AS paths might indicate a BGP hijacking attempt or a misconfiguration issue that requires immediate investigation. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Contact ISPs involved (AS8359 and AS8342):** Verify if the announcement is legitimate or a result of misconfiguration.\n- **Monitor BGP Announcements:** Continue to monitor BGP updates for further announcements by these ASes related to 104.244.42.0/24.\n- **Communication with Affected Parties:** Network operators should be informed to mitigate potential routing or traffic issues to avoid downtime or data interception.\n\n**Note:** This report is based on BGP data observations and should be confirmed with appropriate operational measures by relevant network authorities. Further monitoring and analysis are recommended to verify and address the anomaly."
