"### BGP Anomaly Detection Report\n\n#### Incident Summary\n- **Date and Time of Detection:** 2019-06-06, 09:57:00\n- **Affected IP Prefix:** 46.145.0.0/16\n- **Anomaly Type:** BGP Hijacking or Route Leak\n\n#### Description\nOn June 6, 2019, at 09:57:00 UTC, an anomaly was detected in the BGP announcements for the IP prefix 46.145.0.0/16. The event is characterized by a sudden change in the advertised AS paths from certain collectors, indicating a potential BGP hijack or a route leak.\n\n#### Detailed Analysis\n- **Paths Before the Event:**\n  - From collector `rrc05`, the IP prefix 46.145.0.0/16 was primarily reachable through AS paths:\n    - `47692 \u2192 1136`\n    - `13237 \u2192 1136`\n  \n- **Paths After the Event:**\n  - Post-event data from the same collector shows the introduction of additional AS paths, specifically:\n    - `35369 \u2192 2914 \u2192 4134 \u2192 21217 \u2192 13237 \u2192 1136`\n    - `47147 \u2192 1299 \u2192 4134 \u2192 21217 \u2192 13237 \u2192 1136`\n    - `6720 \u2192 8447 \u2192 1299 \u2192 4134 \u2192 21217 \u2192 13237 \u2192 1136`\n\nThese abnormal AS paths suggest that AS 4134 and AS 21217 have become involved in the announcement of the IP prefix 46.145.0.0/16, which was not observed in historical data. The introduction of AS 4134, commonly associated with a large ISP, might suggest a possible BGP hijack or a misconfiguration resulting in a route leak. \n\n#### Possible Causes\n1. **BGP Hijacking:** Unauthorized AS(es) could be announcing the IP prefix, causing traffic to be misrouted through AS 4134 and AS 21217.\n2. **Route Leak:** Misconfiguration or policy violation in the routing by AS 13237 or upstream providers (such as AS 4134) could lead to unintended propagation of routes.\n\n#### Related AS Numbers\n- **Authorized**: 1136 (Original and consistent destination AS)\n- **Unauthorized/Anomalous**:\n  - 13237\n  - 4134\n  - 21217\n\n#### Recommendations\n- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor BGP announcements for the affected and related IP prefixes using tools capable of real-time anomaly detection.\n- **Verification with AS Operators:** Confirm the legitimacy of the routing changes with the operators of the involved ASes (13237, 4134, and 21217).\n- **Enhanced Security Measures:** Implement RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and route filtering to prevent future unauthorized announcements.\n- **Incident Response:** Notify the operators of AS 1136 about the anomaly for further investigation.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe observed anomaly likely stems from either a BGP hijacking event or a route leak, leading to unintended AS paths involving AS 4134 and 21217. Prompt investigation and corrective actions are needed to restore standard routing practices for the affected IP prefix.\n\n---\n\nDue to the potential for critical impact on network operations, it is advised to engage in immediate communication with the operators responsible for the ASes involved in the anomalous routing. By doing so, the intended routing policy can be swiftly reinstated, ensuring the reliability and security of the affected IP prefix."
