"**BGP Anomaly Report**\n\n**Date and Time of Event:**  \nEvent detected on 2008-02-24 at 18:49:00 UTC.\n\n**Target IP Prefix:**  \n208.65.153.0/24  \n\n**Anomaly Type:**  \nIP Hijacking or Prefix Hijacking  \n\n**Related Autonomous Systems (AS):**  \n- AS17557 (Pakistan Telecom)\n- AS3491 (PCCW Global)\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**  \nThe BGP anomaly concerning the IP prefix 208.65.153.0/24, detected on February 24, 2008, appears to be a classic case of IP hijacking. In the data prior to the anomaly, the prefix 208.65.153.0/24 was part of a larger aggregate (208.65.152.0/22), consistently being announced by AS36561 across a variety of paths. \n\nDuring the anomaly event, the prefix 208.65.153.0/24 started being announced independently with AS17557 at the end of the AS paths, instead of AS36561. This change was visible across multiple collector paths, all now showing the prefix being routed through AS3491 and ultimately AS17557, which was not seen in historical paths for this prefix.\n\nThis sudden appearance of AS17557 in the path suggests that traffic meant for this prefix was misrouted, likely due to a misconfiguration or a deliberate hijack by AS17557. AS3491, a prominent upstream provider, is involved in propagating this route, showing this as a broader issue rather than isolated.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Date and Time:** 2008-02-24 18:49:00 UTC  \n- **Event Type:** BGP IP Hijacking  \n- **Prefix:** 208.65.153.0/24  \n- **Entities Involved:** AS17557 (destination of the hijack), AS3491 (carrier of the path)  \n- **Description:** An abnormal routing event likely caused by AS17557 improperly announcing a specific prefix typically routed through AS36561. This resulted in the prefix being incorrectly routed through alternative paths, leading to potential traffic misdirection for networks trying to reach the advertised IPs.\n\nThis represents a significant deviation from expected routing paths and indicates the need for network operators to engage in practices such as route filtering and prefix-list validation to mitigate future incidents of this nature. Further investigation and coordination with AS17557, AS3491, and affected network operators can help identify the root cause and rectify the issue."
