"### BGP Network Anomaly Detection Report\n\n**Date of Event:** 2022-02-03\n\n**Time of Event:** 01:04:00\n\n**Target IP Prefix:** 211.249.216.0/21\n\n---\n\n**Anomaly Type:** New Prefix Announcement / Possible Route Hijacking\n\n**Related Autonomous System (AS) Number:** AS199524, AS37468, AS37497, AS37271, AS37239\n\n**Affected IP Address:** 211.249.221.0/24\n\n---\n\n#### Anomaly Description:\n\nDuring the analysis of the BGP updates for the IP prefix 211.249.216.0/21, it was observed that a new specific sub-prefix, 211.249.221.0/24, was announced post-event by various ASs (AS199524, AS37468, AS37497, AS37271, AS37239). This specific sub-prefix was not present in the routing tables before the event, suggesting a possible new route announcement or route hijacking incident.\n\n#### Analysis of the Event:\n\n1. **Before the Event:** \n    - The prefix 211.249.216.0/21 was routed through multiple paths via AS3491, AS37497, AS37239, AS37468, AS57695, AS199524, and AS37271.\n    - There was no record of 211.249.221.0/24 being announced or visible in the routing tables.\n\n2. **After the Event:**\n    - The prefix 211.249.221.0/24 appeared, and all originating ASs for this specific prefix had empty AS Path entries, meaning there was a visibility of zero-length paths for these ASs, which can indicate a new announcement from these ASs or a configuration change causing the prefix to be visible without a full path.\n    - This could represent a specific announcement for more granular route management, possibly affecting routing policies or indicating a more granular hijacking attempt.\n\n#### Possible Impacts:\n- The appearance of a more specific /24 prefix could lead to traffic being redirected or blackholed if it was not intended or coordinated with upstream providers.\n- Depending on the nature of this change, it could potentially affect network reachability, performance, and latency for networks attempting to reach this prefix.\n  \n#### Recommendations:\n- Verify with AS199524, AS37468, AS37497, AS37271, and AS37239 whether there was a legitimate change intended to announce 211.249.221.0/24 at this specific time.\n- Monitor for any further anomalous activity or reversion to previous routing states.\n- Multiple ASes should coordinate to check for consistency in route propagation and apply appropriate filtering or route validation mechanisms to mitigate potential hijacking.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThis anomaly event appears to center around a new prefix announcement for 211.249.221.0/24. Verification is necessary to determine if it was a legitimate network engineering change or potentially malicious activity, such as route hijacking or leaks. Further analysis and monitoring should be conducted to ensure network integrity and performance are maintained.\n\n---"
