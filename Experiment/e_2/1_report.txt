"Based on the provided BGP data, I have identified an anomaly event associated with the IP prefix 104.244.42.0/24. The analysis indicates a possible hijacking or routing misconfiguration involving the AS paths before and after the event.\n\n---\n\n### BGP Anomaly Event Report\n\n**Event Time**: 2022-03-28 12:05:00\n\n**IP Prefix**: 104.244.42.0/24\n\n**Anomaly Type**: Potential Route Hijacking or Misconfiguration\n\n**Affected Collector**: rrc05\n\n**Description**:\n\n- **Before the Event**:\n  - The path to the prefix 104.244.42.0/24 via AS 6720 was through AS 8447 and then AS 13414.\n  \n- **After the Event**:\n  - The path to the prefix 104.244.42.0/24 via AS 6720 altered to include two additional ASNs: AS 8359 and AS 8342, before reaching the original AS 8447 and final destination AS 13414.\n\n**Analysis**:\nThe introduction of two new AS numbers (8359 and 8342) in the AS path from the peer associated with AS 6720 suggests a possible BGP hijack or misconfiguration. This change may indicate an unauthorized announcement or an alteration that affects the path's transparency and trustworthiness, potentially causing traffic redirection or loss of connectivity.\n\n**Related AS Numbers**:\n- **Original AS Path**: 6720, 8447, 13414\n- **Altered AS Path**: 6720, 8447, 8359, 8342, 13414\n\n**Potential Causes**:\n1. **Route Hijacking**: Unauthorized entities may have announced the prefix to divert traffic through their networks, indicated by the unexpected addition of AS 8359 and AS 8342.\n   \n2. **Misconfiguration**: An administrative or configuration error might have resulted in an unintended change in the routing table, leading to the altered AS path.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- **Immediate Actions**:\n  1. Verify with network operators of AS 6720, AS 8359, and AS 8342 for any changes or issues in their BGP configurations.\n  2. Check for any suspicious or unauthorized announcements in BGP monitoring tools to ensure the integrity of routing paths.\n  \n- **Preventive Measures**:\n  1. Implement route filtering and validation mechanisms such as RPKI to prevent unauthorized route announcements.\n  2. Regularly monitor BGP route announcements for any unauthorized changes.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the sudden change in AS path involving additional entities, there is a significant indication of a possible route hijacking or misconfiguration event. Coordination with the related AS operators is crucial to resolve the anomaly and secure the routing path.\n\n---\n\nThis report has been generated using the data available; if further details are required, especially from other collectors or additional historical data for a broader analysis, please indicate so for a more thorough examination."
