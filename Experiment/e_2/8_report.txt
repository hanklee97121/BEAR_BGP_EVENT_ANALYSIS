"Title: BGP Anomaly Event Report for IP Prefix 101.101.101.0/24\n\n---\n\n**Event Time:**\n- Anomaly Detected Start Time: 2019-05-08 15:08:00\n\n**Anomaly Description:**\nA BGP anomaly event was detected involving the IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24. The event involved anomalous changes in the AS paths announced to reach the target IP prefix. This is indicative of either a BGP hijacking or route leak incident, characterized by unauthorized or unexpected path announcements.\n\n**Anomaly Type:**\n- Potential BGP Hijacking or Route Leak\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Historical and Pre-Event Analysis: Before the anomaly, all paths to the IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24 were stable and consistently included AS paths passing through AS6453 and AS3462 to the origin AS131621, following expected routes.\n  \n- Post-Event Changes: AS path alterations after the anomaly show paths that include AS segments such as '2828', '4230', and '268869', which previously did not appear in observed paths to the IP prefix. There are unexpected transitions in the AS paths, including:\n  - Some paths that used to traverse AS6762 and AS9680 now include AS4230 and AS268869.\n  - Some paths that used to route through AS3356 now go through AS2828 and continue to AS268869.\n\n**Affected ASes:**\n- Undesired ASes appearing in new paths: AS2828, AS4230, AS268869.\n\n**Affected IP Address Range:**\n- 101.101.101.0/24\n\n**Related AS Numbers:**\n- Original Origin AS: AS131621\n- Unexpected ASes Detected Post-Event: AS2828, AS4230, AS268869\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sudden inclusion of unexpected autonomous systems (AS2828, AS4230, AS268869) in the routing paths to the IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24 suggests that the prefix may have been hijacked or leaked. This warrants immediate attention to confirm the nature of the changes and to ensure the integrity of the advertised routes.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Validate BGP announcements against known valid prefixes and AS paths.\n2. Implement prefix filtering and origin validation (RPKI) to prevent unauthorized route advertisements.\n3. Collaborate with affected and transit providers to confirm the legitimacy of path changes or rectify unauthorized announcements.\n4. Monitor for further unauthorized BGP announcements to prevent recurrence of similar incidents.\n\nNote: Ongoing monitoring and collaboration with ISPs and network security teams are recommended to fully trace and address the issue.\n\n--- \n\n**Disclaimer:** This report is based on the BGP data provided and is subject to further validation with additional insights or data from network operators managing these prefixes."
