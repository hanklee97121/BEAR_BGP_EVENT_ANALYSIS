"Based on the provided data, it appears that there is insufficient information to diagnose the anomaly event affecting the IP prefix 5.35.230.0/24. All data provided before and after the anomaly indicate no available AS paths from the collector 'rrc26'. Here is a detailed breakdown and report:\n\n---\n\n**BGP Anomaly Report**\n\n**Date and Time of Anomaly Detection:** 2021-04-16 13:48:00\n\n**IP Prefix Affected:** 5.35.230.0/24\n\n**Anomaly Type:** \n\n- **Type:** Data Insufficiency\n- **Description:** The data provided before and after the anomaly event contains no AS path information from the relevant collector, which suggests either a complete withdrawal of the IP prefix visibility in BGP routes or the lack of data collection capability from the specified collector ('rrc26') at the given time.\n\n**Analysis based on historical paths data:**\n\n1. Historically, many collectors have consistently had paths to the IP prefix 5.35.230.0/24, often terminating at AS 20773, with AS 8972 appearing consistently in paths as well.\n2. The absence of paths from 'rrc26' both before and after the event could indicate an issue specific to the data collection process or connectivity issues faced by the collector, rather than an anomalous event concerning the 5.35.230.0/24 prefix itself.\n\n**Related AS Numbers:**\n\n- Due to the lack of current path data from 'rrc26', no new AS numbers are directly implicated by this event.\n  \n**IP Address Affected:**\n\n- No specific IP addresses within the prefix 5.35.230.0/24 are highlighted due to the absence of AS path data.\n\n**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n\n1. Verify the operational status of the 'rrc26' collector at the time of the anomaly.\n2. Cross-reference with other collectors to confirm if the anomaly was isolated to 'rrc26' or if it is observed across different collectors.\n3. Check for withdrawal events reported by AS 20773 or AS 8972, which could explain a disappearance of routes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout the necessary BGP AS path data both before and after the anomaly event, it is challenging to definitively diagnose the nature of the event. Further data from additional collectors or insight into the operational state of 'rrc26' at the time would be essential to form a comprehensive analysis.\n\n**Data Required for Conclusive Report:**\n\n- AS path visibility from other collectors surrounding the time of the anomaly.\n- Confirmation of any withdrawal or peering issue affecting AS 20773 or AS 8972.\n- Operational logs or status reports from 'rrc26'.\n\n--- \n\nPlease provide the additional data mentioned above or confirm the operational status of the collectors involved to enable a more complete and accurate analysis."
