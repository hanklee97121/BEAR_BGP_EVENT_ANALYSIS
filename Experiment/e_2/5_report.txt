"## BGP Anomaly Report\n\n### Event Overview\n- **Target IP Prefix**: 201.157.49.0/24\n- **Event Start Time**: 2021-02-11 04:36:41\n\n### Anomaly Type\nThe anomaly detected is an IP prefix hijack. This is indicated by the fact that paths to a more specific IP prefix (201.157.49.0/24) appeared after the event, while previously only the aggregate prefix 201.157.0.0/17 was visible in the BGP table.\n\n### Detailed Observations\n\n1. **Paths Before the Event**:\n   - All paths to the target were directed to the aggregate prefix 201.157.0.0/17.\n   - Paths included multiple ASNs such as 9002, 1299, 22566, among others, indicating a stable routing.\n\n2. **Paths After the Event**:\n   - A new and more specific prefix 201.157.49.0/24 appeared in the BGP routing table.\n   - This specific prefix did not have valid AS paths for most peers, indicating a sudden and unauthorized announcement of this prefix.\n   - Notably, AS 51088 announced a path including AS 6453 and unrelated ASes 1299, 18734, 28548, 14178, 22566 for the IP prefix 201.157.49.0/24, which suggests an unusual and likely malicious BGP advertisement.\n\n3. **Comparison with Historical Data**:\n   - Historically, there were no records of the more specific prefix 201.157.49.0/24.\n   - The appearance of this prefix after the anomaly indicates a potential sub-prefix hijack aimed at capturing traffic destined for part of the larger aggregate.\n\n### Impact Assessment\n- **Potential Trafic Redirection**: The more specific prefix likely redirected traffic away from its legitimate destination.\n- **Network Security**: This type of anomaly can lead to data interception or traffic analysis by malicious entities.\n\n### Related AS Numbers and IPs\n- **Involved ASNs**: 51088, 6453, 1299, 18734, 28548, 14178, 22566\n- **Newly Announced Path**: AS path from AS 51088 -> 6453 -> 1299 -> 18734 -> 28548 -> 14178 -> 22566\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendations\nThe detected anomaly suggests that a BGP hijacking event occurred, likely involving an unauthorized announcement of a more specific prefix (201.157.49.0/24) to disrupt established traffic flows. Immediate actions should be taken to investigate and correct the unauthorized BGP announcement. This can involve coordination with affected ISPs and AS operators to filter out the malicious path announcements and restore correct routing.\n\n### Additional Data Required\n- Confirmation from relevant network operators regarding the invalid paths.\n- Logs or additional data from potentially affected networks to understand the impact scope.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe resolution time will depend on coordination efforts with the involved ASes and ISPs to nullify the hijacked path advertisement and re-establish proper route advertisement policies for the original aggregate prefix."
