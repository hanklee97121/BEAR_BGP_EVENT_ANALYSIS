"### BGP Anomaly Report\n\n**Date and Time of Event:**  \nStart: 2005-05-07 14:37:56\n\n**IP Prefix of Concern:**  \n64.233.161.0/24\n\n**Anomaly Type:**  \nBlackholing or Connectivity Loss\n\n**Affected Autonomous Systems (ASes):**  \nThe report does not provide specific AS numbers directly involved in the anomaly from the current path data, as no paths were available during the event for comparison.\n\n**Collector Details:**  \n- **Before Event:** `rrc20` provided no AS paths to the IP prefix.\n- **After Event:** `rrc20` continued to provide no AS paths to the IP prefix.\n\n**Historical Path Information:**  \nHistorically, multiple diverse AS paths to the IP prefix 64.233.161.0/24 have been observed from different collectors, indicating normal operations. These paths frequently involve AS15169 (Google) as the origin:\n\n- Examples include paths such as `['7018', '3356', '15169']`, `['513', '5511', '15169']`, and `['20932', '3356', '15169']`.\n\n**Event Analysis:**  \nBased on the data provided:\n\n- **No Paths Detected:** Before and after the event start time, the collector `rrc20` did not detect any AS paths leading to the IP prefix 64.233.161.0/24. This suggests a complete loss of connectivity or a blackholing event where the prefix became unreachable from this collector\u2019s perspective.\n  \n- **Suspected Causes:** This could occur due to policy changes, misconfigurations leading to route withdrawal, or network disruptions such as cable cuts, equipment failure, or deliberate filtering/blocking of the prefix 64.233.161.0/24.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe absence of routing paths to the IP prefix 64.233.161.0/24 indicates a significant anomaly event characterized by a complete loss of routes visible to the collector `rrc20`. The specific ASes responsible for the anomaly cannot be determined without additional data due to the lack of path information around the time of the anomaly.\n\n**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n\n1. Validate the absence of path data with other collectors for a broader perspective.\n2. Check for route withdrawals or announcements for the affected prefix from other ASes during the event timeframe.\n3. Consult network operation logs from AS15169 and other upstream or direct peers for any incident reports or network changes.\n\nIf further analysis or confirmation is required, additional data such as BGP updates, announcements, and withdrawals logs from other collectors would be needed to pinpoint the exact nature and cause of the anomaly."
