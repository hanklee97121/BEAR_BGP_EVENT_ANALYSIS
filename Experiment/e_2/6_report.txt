"**BGP Anomaly Detection Report**\n\n**Date of Detection**: July 30, 2020  \n**Time of Detection**: 01:15:38 UTC  \n**Affected IP Prefix**: 99.225.224.0/19  \n\n### Anomaly Type\n\nThe event appears to be a BGP hijacking or route injection incident. This type of anomaly occurs when a wrong or unauthorized BGP route is announced for an IP prefix, leading to traffic potentially being redirected, intercepted, or dropped.\n\n### Anomaly Description\n\nUpon comparing the BGP paths to the IP prefix 99.225.224.0/19 from before and after the anomaly event, a few key differences were noted:\n\n- **Before the Event**: There were no specific paths announced for the prefix 99.225.224.0/19 in the BGP tables. Instead, the primary paths were to broader prefixes like 99.224.0.0/11 and 99.225.192.0/18.\n  \n- **After the Event**: New paths specifically to 99.225.224.0/19 appeared instantaneously. These included:\n  - `25091` -> `1299` -> `7219` -> `10990`\n  - `12779` -> `2914` -> `1299` -> `7219` -> `10990`\n  - `49434` -> `35280` -> `2914` -> `1299` -> `7219` -> `10990`\n  - `29075` -> `174` -> `1299` -> `7219` -> `10990`\n\nThe presence of multiple AS paths that specifically list the prefix 99.225.224.0/19 after the event, combined with the absence of this specific prefix before the event, suggests an unauthorized announcement.\n\n### Related AS Numbers\n\n- **Unauthorized Autonomous Systems Involved**: \n  - AS `7219` (Cogent Communications)\n  - AS `10990` (often used interchangeably within such paths, depending on the specific incident and misconfigurations or manipulations involved)\n\n### Potential Causes\n\n- **Hijacking or Misannouncement**: \n  - The observed phenomenon indicates a potential route hijack, presumably accidentally or maliciously introduced by incorrect route announcements.\n  \n- **Route Leak**: \n  - Although this looks more like a hijack, sometimes incorrectly configured policies lead to unintentional advertisements that can disrupt paths and look similar to a hijack.\n\n### Impact\n\n- **Traffic Disruption**: Traffic intended for the legitimate holder of the IP prefix (99.225.224.0/19) might have been rerouted through unauthorized routes, affecting data flow and service availability.\n- **Potential Data Interception**: During the period of affected routing, any data sent via these new paths could have been susceptible to interception or logging.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Immediate Response**: Verify the validity of announcements related to the IP prefix in question with relevant network operators. Corrective action should be to update or retract incorrect BGP announcements.\n- **Monitoring and Analysis**: Set up route-origin authorization through RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and continuous BGP monitoring tools to detect any future unauthorized announcements quickly.\n- **Incident Review**: Collaborate with directly affected AS operators (e.g., AS `7219` and AS `10990`) to understand the cause better and arrange more robust filtering and validation policies in the future.\n\n### Data Gaps and Additional Information Needed\n\n- **Detailed RIR (Regional Internet Registry) Database Entries**: Information on the legitimate holder of the prefix.\n- **Additional Feedback from Affected ASes**: Logs and configurations that led to the announcement.\n- **RPKI Status**: Verification of the certificate state for the prefix 99.225.224.0/19 to understand if RPKI can prevent such occurrences consistently.\n\nThis report outlines the primary findings from the provided data. For comprehensive incident handling, further coordination with network operators involved and possibly regulatory bodies might be necessary."
