"### BGP Anomaly Report\n\n#### Event Summary\n- **Target IP Prefix**: 205.251.192.0/23\n- **Event Start Time**: 2018-04-24 11:05:00 UTC\n- **Detecting Collector**: rrc23\n\n#### Anomaly Type\nThe anomaly observed is a \"BGP Sub-prefix Hijack.\" This type of event involves the unauthorized advertisement of more specific sub-prefixes of an existing IP prefix, potentially diverting or intercepting traffic to these sub-prefixes.\n\n#### Details\n\n##### Historical Routing Information\n- **Normal Historical BGP Paths**:\n  - For the prefix 205.251.192.0/23, paths typically terminate at AS 16509.\n  - AS 16509 is consistently the originating AS across multiple Route Collectors and peers.\n\n##### Routing Information Before the Event\n- **BGP Paths Before Event**:\n  - The prefix 205.251.192.0/23 is reached via paths such as:\n    - AS path: 18106 \u2192 2914 \u2192 16509\n    - AS path: 17639 \u2192 16509\n  - These are consistent with historical paths showing AS 16509 as the legitimate origin.\n\n##### Routing Information After the Event\n- **BGP Paths After Event**:\n  - The original prefix 205.251.192.0/23 maintains prior paths.\n  - **New Advertisements**:\n    - The new prefixes 205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24 appeared:\n      - Advertised with the AS path: 18106 \u2192 6939 \u2192 10297\n\n#### Related AS Numbers\n- **Legitimate Origin AS**: 16509\n- **Suspicious Origin AS**: 10297 (originating the more specific /24 sub-prefixes)\n\n#### Implications\nThe announcement of the two more specific sub-prefixes (205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24) could lead to traffic intended for the larger prefix 205.251.192.0/23 being rerouted to a potentially unauthorized or malicious entity, which could cause:\n- Routing instability\n- Potential traffic interception\n- Disruption of services hosted on the legitimate IP space\n\n#### Recommendations\n- **Immediate Action**: Network operators and downstream ASes should adjust filtering policies to reject the unapproved sub-prefix announcements from AS 10297.\n- **Investigate**: The concerned parties should investigate the intent of the announcements from AS 10297 to determine if this was accidental or malicious.\n- **Communicate**: Coordinate with affected networks and industry groups to share findings and mitigate the impact.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis event represents a significant risk of BGP hijacking through unauthorized sub-prefix advertisement, mainly affecting traffic designation and distribution aimed at the target IP prefix 205.251.192.0/23. Timely action and coordination among network providers are crucial to mitigate risks. \n\nNote: Additional detailed historical path data from other collectors could further validate findings but based on the provided information, the analysis stands."
