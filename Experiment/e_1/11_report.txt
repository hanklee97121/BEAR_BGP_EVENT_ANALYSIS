"## BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 64.233.161.0/24\n\n### Event Overview\n\n- **Date & Time of Anomaly Detection:** 2005-05-07 14:37:56\n- **IP Prefix Affected:** 64.233.161.0/24\n- **Detected Anomaly:** Unusual path changes involving the addition of AS 60916\n- **Related Autonomous System (AS):** AS 60916\n- **Collectors Reporting the Event:** rrc00, rrc01, rrc03, rrc04, rrc07, rrc11, rrc12\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### Historical Path Observations:\nPrior to the anomaly event, the AS paths to the IP prefix 64.233.161.0/24 across various collectors were stable and consistent, usually terminating at AS 2924. Typical AS paths observed included:\n- **rrc00:** Paths ending at AS 2924 via different intermediate ASes such as 85349, 48017, 36279.\n- **rrc01:** Paths consistent to AS 2924 through ASes like 85349 and 23724.\n- **rrc03:** Paths consistently terminating at AS 2924, with a notable reliance on ASes such as 85349, 36279.\n- **rrc12:** Similar paths through ASes like 23724 and 36279 before reaching AS 2924.\n\n#### Changes Observed During the Anomaly:\nPost anomaly, there was a significant change in the AS paths for the affected IP prefix:\n- **Addition of AS 60916:** A new AS 60916 appeared in the paths for multiple collectors (e.g., rrc00, rrc03). Notably, it appeared as the last AS or close to the termination in paths previously stable to AS 2924.\n  - Example from rrc03: Path changed from termination at AS 2924 to being intercepted by AS 60916.\n  - Examples of AS paths inclusion: AS paths like ['48524', '60916'], ['90265', '85339', '60916'], ['11662', '48453', '60916'] were observed.\n\n- **Impact on Path Lengths and Stability:** The inclusion of AS 60916 led to altered and generally lengthened AS paths. Some paths even showed an abrupt termination (e.g., rrc03 showing a completely empty path [''] from AS 52764, implying possible withdrawal or blackholing).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe anomaly event was characterized primarily by the unauthorized or unexpected presence of AS 60916 in the AS paths to the target prefix 64.233.161.0/24. This presence replaced or de-routed the paths which typically concluded at AS 2924, thus potentially causing reachability issues or interception. This indicates a potential hijack or misconfiguration event involving AS 60916.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Immediate Investigation:** The network administrators responsible for AS 60916 should be contacted to verify the correctness of the advertisements originating from their network.\n2. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Continuous monitoring and alerts set up for abrupt AS path changes across vital prefixes should be enhanced to catch similar anomalies in real time.\n3. **Coordination with Peers:** Engage with other network operators and peers to rectify BGP anomalies collaboratively, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of routing announcements. \n\nThe report suggests investigating AS 60916 immediately to confirm if this was a configuration error, a malicious hijack, or some other routing anomaly. Further historical path analysis and network policies should be reviewed to understand the potential causes and prevent recurrence."
