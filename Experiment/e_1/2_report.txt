"Subject: BGP Anomaly Detection Report for IP Prefix 208.65.153.0/24\n\nDate of Analysis: 2008-02-24\n\n**Anomaly Initial Detection Time:**\n- Start Date: 2008-02-24\n- Start Time: 18:49:00 (UTC)\n\n**Target IP Prefix:**\n- Affected Prefix: 208.65.153.0/24\n\n**Anomaly Type:**\n- Suspicious BGP Hijack\n\n**Description of the Anomaly:**\n\nOn February 24, 2008, at approximately 18:49 UTC, an anomaly involving the IP prefix 208.65.153.0/24 was detected. Prior to this event, BGP paths to the target prefix were not present in the routing tables of the monitored collectors. After the event, paths to the specific sub-prefix 208.65.153.0/24 appeared in significant numbers across various collectors.\n\n**Observed Change in BGP AS Paths:**\n\n- **Before the Event (208.65.152.0/22):**\n  - The prefix 208.65.152.0/22 was consistently routed to AS36561 (YouTube's previous ASN) via multiple upstream providers.\n  - No specific routes for the sub-prefix 208.65.153.0/24 were recorded.\n\n- **After the Event:**\n  - The IP prefix 208.65.153.0/24 started appearing with a suspect AS path that includes AS3491 and AS17557.\n  - Numerous routes propagated across different collectors such as rrc00, rrc01, and rrc03 showed paths like `3549 3491 17557` indicating AS17557 took over the route by announcing a more specific sub-prefix (208.65.153.0/24), leading to an unconventional routing path.\n  \n**Involved AS Numbers:**\n- **AS3491:** Known to be associated with a wholesaler that potentially misadvertised the more-specific prefix.\n- **AS17557:** This AS suddenly appeared as the origin in routes to 208.65.153.0/24, suggesting an unauthorized origin announcement for these routes.\n\n**IP Address Impact:**\n- The affected prefix 208.65.153.0/24 experienced a rerouting incident caused by a suspected BGP hijack, potentially causing traffic intended for this network to be redirected through unauthorized paths.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis event represents a classic BGP route hijacking scenario where AS17557 propagated a more-specific route to redirect traffic towards the 208.65.153.0/24 prefix. The sudden appearance of AS17557 in the path for multiple collectors where it was not present before indicates an unauthorized prefix announcement, leading to potential service disruptions to the networks downstream of AS36561.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Validation of BGP route announcements should be reinforced using secure routing tools, such as RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure), to prevent unauthorized advertisements.\n- Collaboration and analysis with AS17557 should be considered to understand the root cause and prevent future incidents.\n- Continuous monitoring and rapid response mechanisms should be implemented to identify and mitigate similar occurrences promptly.\n\n**Request for Additional Information:**\nTo further corroborate this incident, logs or additional BGP update messages around the anomaly time frame could provide more insight into the specific origin and sequence of announcements by the involved ASes. This data can enhance understanding and response strategies for future anomalies."
