"## BGP Anomaly Detection Report\n\n### Event Summary\n- **Date and Time of Detection:** 2022-02-03 01:04:00 UTC\n- **Affected IP Prefix:** 211.249.216.0/21\n- **Newly Announced Sub-prefix:** 211.249.221.0/24\n- **Anomaly Type:** Introduction of a Sub-prefix (Possible Sub-prefix Hijacking)\n- **Related AS Numbers:** Multiple ASes withdrew their previous valid paths and either did not adopt the new sub-prefix or advertised it stale.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n**Background:**\nThe IP prefix 211.249.216.0/21 experienced noticeable changes starting at the reported anomaly time. This event predominantly affected the subnets within this prefix, particularly causing issues with the newly observed sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24.\n\n**Observations Before the Event:**\n- The prefix 211.249.216.0/21 was consistently observed through multiple reliable paths, generally ending with AS 6217 before reaching the ending AS 49438 across many collectors.\n- The routing paths remained stable with no significant deviations or additions in the immediate period leading up to the event.\n\n**Changes After the Event:**\n- The sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24 emerged in routing tables which was not present before. This is a common indicator of a BGP anomaly such as a potential prefix hijack.\n- Most peers either started reporting no paths to this new sub-prefix or invalid/stale paths, indicating withdrawals or possibly incorrect advertisements.\n- Overarching, AS paths either show path withdrawals or remain empty for the sub-prefix, indicating instability and lack of propagation.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n- Many collectors show withdrawals of valid routes to the new sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24, evidenced by empty or stale path advertisements across multiple collectors (like 'rrc00', 'rrc01', 'rrc05', etc.).\n- The incident led to route instability across the network, impacting reachability, thus potentially affecting traffic intended for the respective subnets.\n\n**Related AS Numbers Involved:**\n- Collectors repeatedly show AS numbers such as AS8717, AS3778, and AS9272 in BGP paths, which seem to have introduced, withdrawn or left stale paths for the sub-prefix abruptly post-event.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Confirm the legitimacy of the new sub-prefix announcement with corresponding network operators responsible for the main prefix.\n- Further coordination with AS_49438 and its upstream providers is recommended to verify whether the sub-prefix announcement was legitimate or resulted from a misconfiguration or malicious intent.\n- Review and potentially update filters in BGP configurations to prevent unauthorized prefix announcements.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe emergence of the sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24 without prior routing history for the main prefix 211.249.216.0/21 suggests a potential BGP hijacking event or misconfiguration. Immediate investigation and validation are crucial to ensure the trustworthiness of BGP announcements and mitigate possible disruptions in network operations."
