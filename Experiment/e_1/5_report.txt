"### BGP Network Anomaly Report\n\n#### Event Summary\n- **Target IP Prefix**: 201.157.49.0/24\n- **Event Start Time**: 2021-02-11 04:36:41\n- **Anomaly Type**: Potential BGP Hijack or Route Leakage\n- **Related AS Numbers**: 37468, 28548, 14178\n- **Related IP Addresses**: None specified\n\n#### Analysis and Findings\n\n##### Overview\nAn anomaly was detected targeting the IP prefix 201.157.49.0/24 at the specified time. Upon analysis of the BGP AS paths recorded before and after the incident, significant deviations from historical routes were observed.\n\n##### Historical Routing Pattern\n- Historically, the IP prefix 201.157.49.0/24 and its larger aggregate 201.157.0.0/17 were seen following relatively stable paths through major AS numbers such as 2914, 1299, 22566, and paths were consistently announced from different collectors with little to no variation.\n\n##### Observations Before the Event\n- The prefix 201.157.49.0/24 was not specifically advertised separately in historical records but was implicitly aggregated under the larger 201.157.0.0/17.\n- The AS paths reflected standard routes suggesting consistent announcements by legitimate upstream ASes such as 1299 and 22566.\n\n##### Changes Detected After the Event\n- Post-event, the prefix 201.157.49.0/24 was detected being specifically announced with different path setups, indicating new AS paths involving 28548, and 14178, leading to suspicions of a routing anomaly.\n- There appeared to be a pattern where several paths for 201.157.49.0/24 started resolving through unfamiliar AS paths (e.g., 18734 -> 28548 -> 14178 -> 22566) that were not present in prior or historical logs.\n- AS 37468, previously associated with the legitimate larger prefix aggregate, is noted but does not appear directly involved in this specific anomaly detection.\n\n##### Possible Anomaly Type\nThese unusual AS path appearances can suggest potential routing hijack activities or route leaks where unauthorized announcements might be propagated misusing AS paths (e.g., 28548, 14178) to route traffic under false pretenses.\n\n##### Impact Assessment\n- The sudden announcement of this prefix using unexpected AS paths can lead to traffic detours, possible interception, or unavailability if maliciously orchestrated.\n\n#### Recommendations\n- **Further Monitoring**: Immediate ongoing monitoring of the affected IP prefix and any unconventional AS paths associated with it.\n- **AS Verification**: Contact AS 28548 and AS 14178 for confirmation and verification of their routing policies towards the specified prefix during the anomaly timeframe.\n- **Route Filtering**: Implement stricter route filtering mechanisms at relevant Autonomous Systems to mitigate unauthorized announcements.\n- **Investigate Logs**: Review network logs to identify any discrepancies or evidence of misconfigurations or malicious intent.\n\n#### Data Considerations\nThe present data provides adequate information to suspect routing anomalies but could be further complemented by comprehensive logs from affected AS operators to substantiate findings. Additionally, logs or announcements from additional regional Internet routing projects could further clarify the propagation patterns observed during the anomaly.\n\n---\n\nThis report is based on current BGP AS path analytics and may need revisions subject to ongoing investigations or disclosures from involved Autonomous Systems."
