"## BGP Anomaly Report\n\n### Event Overview\n- **Target IP Prefix:** 208.65.153.0/24\n- **Event Detection Timestamp:** 2008-02-24 18:49:00\n\n### Anomaly Type Identified\nThe anomaly is identified as a possible BGP hijacking event involving the IP prefix 208.65.153.0/24. During such events, an unauthorized or malicious AS claims to own a specific IP prefix, potentially rerouting or intercepting data intended for that IP prefix.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### Historical AS Path Patterns\nBefore the anomaly, the prefix 208.65.152.0/22, which includes the 208.65.153.0/24 prefix, was consistently routed through AS 13720 and the originating AS 29049. This routing pattern was stable and observed across several collectors (e.g., rrc00, rrc01, etc.).\n\n#### Changes During the Anomaly\n1. **New /24 Sub-Prefix Advertisement:** A new sub-prefix 208.65.153.0/24 appeared in the network advertisements, which was not observed in the historical and pre-event data.\n2. **Deviation in AS Path:** The advertisement paths for 208.65.153.0/24 included a new AS, 21413, not previously associated with this prefix in any historical routing data:\n   - AS Path entries in various post-event collectors: \n     - Examples include paths such as [...] -> 21413 -> 62200.\n3. **Disconnection from Usual Origin AS:** The paths for the /24 sub-prefix did not terminate with AS 29049, indicating a break from the established legitimate origin for this traffic.\n\n#### Impacted Autonomous Systems\n- AS 21413 and AS 62200 are the new intermediate paths associated with the anomaly.\n- Collectors like rrc00, rrc01, and others show consistent rerouting of paths through AS 21413, indicating a coordinated or widespread hijack attempt.\n\n#### Likelihood of BGP Hijack\nThe appearance of AS 21413 in the AS path for an announcement of 208.65.153.0/24 is highly suggestive of a BGP hijack attempt. Typically, hijacks involve the introduction of new AS paths that are not part of the recognized network infrastructure.\n\n### Recommendation for Network Operators\n- Validate the legitimacy of AS 21413\u2019s claim over 208.65.153.0/24.\n- Notify AS 29049 and AS 13720 of the detected anomaly, as these ASes have historically been part of the legitimate routing path.\n- Reconfigure routing policies to filter unauthorized announcements of the /24 prefix from suspicious AS paths such as those involving AS 21413.\n- Implement more robust route validation practices, such as RPKI, to prevent future hijack attempts.\n\n### Missing Data\nNo additional data is needed for the identification and analysis of this hijack incident compared to historical data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe abnormal routing paths featuring AS 21413 lead to the conclusion of a BGP hijack event beginning on 2008-02-24 at 18:49:00. Immediate actions are recommended to mitigate the compromised routing and secure the stable paths for 208.65.153.0/24. \n\n(Network operators and impacted parties should collaborate to reinforce BGP security practices and ensure adherence to best-practice guidelines.)"
