"### BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 5.35.230.0/24\n\n**Incident Summary:**\n- **Event Start Time:** 2021-04-16 13:48:00 UTC\n- **Target IP Prefix:** 5.35.230.0/24\n- **Parent IP Prefix:** 5.35.224.0/19\n- **Anomaly Type:** AS Path Hijacking/Suspicious Path Modifications\n- **Impacted AS Numbers:** Multiple AS numbers, primarily involving previously unobserved AS path segments for hijacking potential.\n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n1. **Typical Routings (Before Event):**\n   - Historically, the AS path for the IP prefix 5.35.230.0/24 predominantly terminated with `20773` as the origin AS, with the final segment consistently showing `20773, 8972` as seen across different routing collectors.\n   - The networks upstream of 20773 typically included major transit providers such as AS1299, AS3356, AS6939, etc.\n\n2. **Observed Anomalies (After Event):**\n   - **Unexpected AS Interjections:** New paths involving AS `6461`, `9498`, and `55410` appeared in routes where they previously did not exist. These appear between major transit ASes and the final destination AS, indicating potential AS path hijack or misconfiguration.\n   - **Path Withdrawals/Inconsistencies:**\n     - Several AS paths that were stable before the event became withdrawn or inconsistent, as seen with the absence of paths via `AS26073` and `37721` due to possible path hijacking or a massive routing policy update.\n   - **Disruptive Open Peer Paths:** Anomalous paths showing chains involving many usually unrelated ASes, which may suggest tampering or misadvertised shorter paths for traffic interception.\n   - Presence of multiple null routes or missing AS path data, indicating significant route instability for affected prefixes.\n\n3. **Per Collector Breakdown:**\n   - **RRC00, RRC05, RRC10, RRC20:** Significant path changes featuring AS `6939`, `6461`, and `55410`.\n   - **RRC03, RRC06, RRC24:** Show AS `6461` prominence, with additional path anomalies indicating altered routing during the event window.\n\n**Conclusions & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Possible Hijack or Routing Leak:** Given the injection of unknown and unexpected AS paths (e.g., `6461, 9498, 55410`), this event potentially indicates a BGP hijack or a major routing leak resulting in possible man-in-the-middle attacks.\n- **Further Investigation Needed:** Network operators should verify impacted ASes (e.g., `20773`) for any unauthorized configurations or known routing policy changes that may lead to potential security vulnerabilities.\n- **Collaborative Monitoring:** Encouragement for network operators to use BGP monitoring tools to detect similar future anomalies and share findings with security networks to improve collective response capabilities.\n- **Logging and Analysis:** Collect historical BGP data logs, focusing on identifying outliers in AS path announcements to identify the root cause and responsible entities.\n\n**Missing Information or Next Steps:**\n\n- Verification from impacted AS peers needed to determine path authenticity and root cause.\n- Further scrutiny of paths for any presence in historical records to ascertain if new AS paths are legitimate or part of a wider attack vector.\n\nThis report encapsulates detected anomalies and suggests potential impact tied to the monitoring data available. Further collaborative analysis and cooperation across network stakeholders are crucial to mitigate such anomalies efficiently."
