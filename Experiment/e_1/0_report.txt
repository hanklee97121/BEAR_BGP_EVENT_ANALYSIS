"## BGP Anomaly Report\n\n### Date of Incident\nThe anomaly event was detected to have started on May 7, 2005, at 14:37:56 UTC.\n\n### Target IP Prefix\nThe IP prefix involved in the anomaly is 64.233.161.0/24.\n\n### Anomaly Type\nThe anomaly detected is a potential BGP route hijack or misconfiguration, leading to unexpected AS paths reaching the IP prefix.\n\n### Analysis of AS Path Changes\n\n#### Historical and Pre-Event AS Paths\nBefore the event, the paths to 64.233.161.0/24 were predominantly through AS 15169, which is Google\u2019s ASN. The various collector data showed consistent paths involving known transit providers such as AS 3356, AS 6461, and AS 5511, which are major Internet backbone providers.\n\nExample pre-event AS paths for 64.233.161.0/24 included:\n- From rrc00: `['7018', '3356', '15169']`\n- From rrc01: `['8342', '3356', '15169']`\n- From rrc03: `['28747', '174', '15169']`\n\nThese paths all converge to AS 15169, which is the valid origin for the given prefix.\n\n#### Post-Event AS Paths\nAfter the anomaly started, there were notable deviations in the AS paths collected:\n- From rrc00: Paths like `['7018', '174']` appeared, suggesting an abrupt shift in the path that bypasses AS 15169 entirely.\n- From rrc01: Paths like `['8342', '702', '174']` show AS 702 and AS 174 appearing more frequently.\n- From rrc03: Paths with missing hops or final destination as AS 174 such as `['28747', []]`.\n\nThe appearance of AS 174 directly in place of AS 15169 across multiple collectors suggests a potential hijacking incident where AS 174 (Cogent Communications, a large transit provider) might have been injecting routes with itself as the origin for 64.233.161.0/24, effectively intercepting traffic intended for Google.\n\n### Affected Autonomous System (AS)\n- **New Appearing AS: 174** - The sudden appearance of AS 174 as the final destination or in the penultimate position is suspicious. AS 174 is not seen in pre-event or historical data as a typical path component to Google's network.\n\n### Missing Data or Further Investigations\n1. **Confirmation of Intent or Misconfiguration:** Further investigation into the routing advertisements by AS 174 at the time of the incident could help confirm if this was indeed an intentional hijack or an inadvertent route leak.\n2. **Impact Assessment:** Additional data on the global reachability and the impact on end-users and services during the event would help in understanding the severity.\n3. **Communication with AS 174:** Contacting AS 174 for their routing logs or any ongoing changes could give insight into whether this was a deliberate action.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe event detection at 14:37:56 on May 7, 2005, indicates a possible BGP hijack or misconfiguration involving AS 174 taking over the route for 64.233.161.0/24 from AS 15169. Further investigation should be conducted to confirm the nature of this anomaly and its implications."
