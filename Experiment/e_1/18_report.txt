"# Report on BGP Network Anomaly for IP Prefix 46.145.0.0/16\n\n## Overview\n\nAn anomaly event was detected for the IP prefix 46.145.0.0/16 on 2019-06-06 at 09:57:00. This report investigates the anomaly by analyzing the BGP AS paths to the IP prefix before and after the event, comparing them against historical data.\n\n## Event Summary\n\n- **Time of Detection:** 2019-06-06 09:57:00\n- **IP Prefix:** 46.145.0.0/16\n- **Collecting Locations:** Multiple RRC collectors\n- **Anomaly Type:** Likely prefix hijacking or path manipulation\n- **Affected AS Numbers:** Numerous, notably involving AS84467 and AS71196\n- **Affected Prefixes and Sub-prefixes:** 46.145.0.0/16\n\n## Observations\n\n### Historical Data\n\nHistorically, routes to the prefix 46.145.0.0/16 were commonly concluded by AS28382, as observed through several collectors like `rrc00`, `rrc01`, etc., with relatively stable AS paths.\n\n### Before the Event\n\nPrior to the anomaly, the AS paths for 46.145.0.0/16 predominantly ended with AS28382, conforming to expected historical patterns where AS28382 is a consistent last-hop AS before the target prefix. \n\n### After the Event\n\nPost-anomaly analysis illustrates a dramatic shift in AS paths:\n- AS84467 and AS71196 appear in the AS path toward 46.145.0.0/16 and are found inserted unusually across many collectors in the path to the target prefix.\n- AS28382, which historically terminated most routes for this prefix, has been replaced by an unexpected AS, AS19618, following the involvement of AS84467 and AS71196 across various collectors (e.g., collectors `rrc00`, `rrc01`, `rrc03`, `rrc05`, etc.).\n- The paths previously terminating immediately after AS96143/AS32544 now extend to AS19618 beyond AS84467 and AS71196.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe appearance of AS84467 and AS71196 in the paths following the event may suggest that these ASes are attempting an unauthorized rerouting or are involved in a configuration error that redirects paths through them to AS19618. This situation is indicative of a potential prefix hijacking event or misconfiguration causing an AS path alteration affecting reachability and potentially route propagation for the given BGP prefix.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe exhibit of AS path elongation and inclusion of unexpected AS (AS84467, AS71196) to the network paths to reach 46.145.0.0/16 post-alert likely signals a prefix hijacking attempt or severe misconfiguration. Further investigation from the concerned ASes (AS84467, AS71196, AS19618) is advised to resolve any routing irregularities.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n- **Verify AS Announcements:** Check AS84467 and AS71196 for any unauthorized advertisements of the IP prefix.\n- **Audit Routing Policies:** Perform a routing policy audit on ASes involved to ensure compliance and rectify any inadvertent misconfigurations.\n- **Incident Response:** Engage with network operators of AS84467, AS71196, and AS19618 to correct path irregularities and restore normal routing behaviour.\n- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up continuous monitoring and alerting frameworks for early detection of unusual path changes in the network.\n\nThis investigation into the anomaly event highlights the importance of robust monitoring practices for maintaining network security and integrity."
