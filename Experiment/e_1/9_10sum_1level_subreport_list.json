Key findings indicate that sub-prefixes of 2.16.0.0/13 were withdrawn from the routing tables during the anomaly, leading to suspected blackholing events. Additionally, some brief unauthorized AS paths were hinted, suggesting potential hijacking attempts or misconfigurations within AS20940 and AS4826.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Route Withdrawn Patterns:** Multiple sub-prefixes under 2.16.0.0/13, such as 2.19.144.0/20 and 2.18.108.0/22, were suddenly absent from routing tables, indicating an interruption in network reachability.\n2. **AS Path Consistency Pre- and Post-Event:** Most reports indicate that the primary AS paths did not show significant changes, keeping the main paths like `['206499', '6939', '4826', '20940']` consistent before and after the event, suggesting transient anomalies.\n3. **Potential Brief Hijacking Indicators:** The transient inconsistency may hint at brief path hijacks or misconfigurations, likely involving AS4826 or surrounding transit paths that reverted quickly, complicating detection.\n4. **False Positive Detection Mentioned:** Some analyses suggested there might be sensitivity in anomaly detection algorithms, potentially leading to false alarms when BGP route data showed stability.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement detailed, continuous monitoring and data collection, particularly focusing on AS20940 and AS4826, to catch ephemeral path changes.\n- **Network Cooperation:** Engage closely with AS20940 and its peers to verify routing announcements and improve response times to anomalies.\n- **Investigation of Withdrawn Events:** Assess operational changes or external factors causing sub-prefix withdrawals or blackholing within AS environments.\n\n**Further Data Collection Needs:**\n1. **Higher Granularity Data:** Collect more time-granular BGP updates for finer anomaly detection and analysis.\n2. **Comprehensive Collector Involvement:** Widen the scope with additional BGP data collectors for enhanced network anomaly visibility.\n3. **System and Log Correlation:** Integrate system logs and traffic analytics for a multipronged insight into routing behavior alongside BGP path data.\n\nOverall, while the primary AS paths appeared stable, the reports indicate undercurrents of disruptions potentially obscured by transient visibility in the BGP data. Continued vigilance and improved anomaly detection and response mechanisms remain imperative to maintaining IP prefix integrity.", "### Comprehensive Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 2.16.0.0/13\n\n**Event Summary:**\n- **Date and Time of Anomaly Detection:** 2023-05-25 11:21:40 UTC\n- **IP Prefix Concerned:** 2.16.0.0/13\n- **Detection by Collector:** Multiple collectors, notable mention of \"rrc00\"\n\n**Key Findings from Anomalous Reports:**\n\n1. **Introduction of Unexpected AS in Path:**\n   - There was a notable insertion of AS37468 in the AS path where it was not previously present.

The nature of the detected event leans towards being a potential transient routing instability or a false-positive within the anomaly detection systems, as extracted paths before and after the event remain largely unchanged.\n\n#### Observational Details\n- **AS Paths Before Event:** Predominantly paths like `['50628', '3320', '20940']`, and `['58057', '6939', '4826', '20940']` were consistent across collectors.\n- **AS Paths After Event:** Paths maintained consistency with no major deviation or introduction of unexpected ASes. The same paths such as `['20514', '1299', '20940']` and `['49420', '6939', '4826', '20940']` persisted post-event.\n  \n#### Analysis\n- **Consistent Path Reporting:** The reported paths remain consistent throughout the anomaly phase. There were no significant AS path changes noted that would typically signify a BGP anomaly like hijacking, flaps, or withdrawals.\n- **Transient or False Positive Indication:** Given no substantial path changes, it\u2019s probable the anomaly was brief and self-corrected, or it may have been a false alarm triggered by routine BGP activity.\n\n#### Conclusion and Recommendations\n- **Type of Event:** Possible transient routing instability.\n- **Further Action:** Continue monitoring the prefix 2.16.0.0/13 for any recurrence of anomalies and ensure anomaly detection tools are finely tuned to minimize false-positives.\n- **Data Needed:** Additional network performance metrics, like latency and packet loss, and further examination of transient events or policy changes within identified ASes, e.g., AS6939, could yield better insights.\n\nThe reports reflect a uniform stability in paths before and after the detected anomaly time. Further investigation should focus on validating the anomaly detection system and gathering additional network context to correlate with potential invisible disruptions not captured by AS path observations.", "### Summary BGP Anomaly Report\n\n**Date and Time:**  \n- **Event Start:** 2023-05-25 11:21:40 UTC\n\n**Target IP Prefix:**  \n- **IP Prefix:** 2.16.0.0/13\n\n**Anomaly Identified:**  \n- **Type:** Potential Path Hijacking or Misconfiguration\n- **Primary Involved AS:** 37468\n- **Baseline AS Path (Before Anomaly):** Predominantly involved AS 20940 across multiple collector data\n- **Anomalous AS Path (During Anomaly):** Introduction or increased appearance of AS 37468 in paths\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**  \nReviewing data from multiple reports, consistent paths involving AS 20940 were observed before the anomaly detection. However, post-event data from certain reports indicates a notable presence of AS 37468, which deviates from historical routing paths and was not part of regular or anticipated paths observed in historical data. This emergence suggests a potential BGP route hijacking or misconfiguration event:\n\n1. **Path Stability:** Pre-event paths were stable with typical transit involving AS 20940.\n2. **Anomaly Identification:** The increased presence of AS 37468 indicates potential unauthorized announcements or accidental misconfigurations impacting paths related to the 2.16.0.0/13 prefix.\n3. **Discrepancy in AS Paths:** No significant deviation was recorded in some reports, which could limit the extent of observable inconsistencies without broader peer analysis.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- **Monitoring and Validation:** Increase monitoring activities for IP prefix 2.16.0.0/13 and scrutinize any anomalies involving AS 37468.\n- **Security Measures:** Encourage AS operators involved, especially AS 37468, to evaluate routing announcements and configurations, potentially adopting RPKI or BGPsec for validations.\n- **Collaboration and Communication:** Engage with network operators managing AS 37468 for discussing the anomaly, ensuring proper routing policy adherence and addressing possible misconfigurations swiftly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile post-event data remains predominantly unchanged in some collector datasets, the detected presence of AS 37468 in others warrants deeper investigation to conclude the scope of the anomaly accurately. Continuous monitoring and collaborative actions with relevant AS operators would be prudent to mitigate any ongoing routing issues or prevent future anomalies.", "### Consolidated BGP Anomaly Report\n\n**Event Overview:**\n- **Date and Time of Event**: 2023-05-25 11:21:40 UTC\n- **Impacted IP Prefix**: 2.16.0.0/13\n- **Data Source**: Multiple BGP collectors\n\n---\n\n**Analyzed AS Paths:**\n\nSeveral BGP reports from different collectors and times indicate that the AS paths for the prefix 2.16.0.0/13 remained consistent through the anomaly detection period:\n\n1. **Representative AS Paths:**\n   - Historical, pre-event, and post-event AS paths displayed consistency with paths such as [3303, 12874], [30844, 37545, 20940], and [8966, 20940].\n   - No introduction of unexpected AS numbers or changes in AS sequences across the observed data.\n\n2. **Key AS Numbers**:\n   - AS paths stably involved AS numbers such as 20940, 30844, 8607, and others, with no alterations detected in their sequences.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nDespite the anomaly flagged at the specified time, the analyzed BGP data from multiple collectors show no detectable changes in AS paths for the IP prefix 2.16.0.0/13. This suggests:\n\n1. **Potential False Positive**: The anomaly detection systems might have flagged the event erroneously without an actual impact on route announcements.\n2. **Transient Events**: If any disruptions occurred, they might have been brief and resolved quickly, leaving no persistent traces in observed data.\n3. **Alternative Causes**: While consistent AS paths imply no hijack or route leak, other network issues such as transient network touches or temporary connectivity glitches may have triggered the anomaly without affecting the AS path.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations for Further Action:**\n\n1. **System Review**: Evaluate the anomaly detection thresholds and configuration to enhance detection accuracy, reducing false positives.\n2. **Expanded Data Collection**: Consider incorporating real-time BGP monitoring and broader telemetry data to detect transient events or explore anomalies not visible solely through AS path analysis.\n3. **Network Operator Engagement**: Contact relevant AS operators (such as AS20940 and AS8607) for potential insights on configuration changes, maintenance events, or temporary routing adjustments that might have influenced network performance metrics, even if not impacting AS paths per se.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed analysis confirms no changes within the BGP AS paths during the period of the alleged anomaly for the specified IP prefix 2.16.0.0/13 across data received.

Notably, four reports highlighted a consistent AS path for the prefix pre- and post-event, described as [42541, 6939, 4826, 20940]. This path maintained stability, suggesting a lack of typical BGP anomalies such as hijacking, significant path deviation, or route leaks.\n\nHowever, two other reports detected discrepancies suggestive of BGP anomalies:\n1. **Temporary Path Alteration:** Instances where the route was briefly withdrawn and re-announced were noted, detected via a new prefix introduction (2.18.112.0/23), coinciding closely with the original detection time.\n2. **Potential False Positive:** The consistent AS paths observed by most reports indicate that the initial anomaly detection could have resulted from false positives or transient network states not resulting in permanent path changes.\n\n#### Confirmed Observations\n- **No Long-Term Path Changes:** Majority of peer data analyzed showed enduring consistency in the AS paths pre- and post-event, with [42541, 6939, 4826, 20940] persisting.\n- **Possible False Alarm:** Some reports suggest anomaly triggers might stem from network monitoring errors or transient visibility issues within certain collections.\n\n#### Recommendations\n1. **Validate Detection Systems:** Review BGP monitoring and anomaly detection algorithms to minimize sensitivity to ephemeral or non-impactful events.\n2. **Broaden Monitoring Scope:** Incorporate additional data from diverse collectors to enrich analysis and confirm anomalies more comprehensively.\n3. **Examine Additional Metrics:** Consider other relevant BGP attributes (e.g., update frequency, stability metrics) in future incidents to more accurately distinguish between genuine and misleading anomaly signals.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe majority consensus among received reports does not support substantial changes in routing paths. The anomaly's characteristics suggest possibilities of false detection, brief transient routing states, or external factors not directly observable within AS path analysis alone.

Analysis from multiple data reports indicates that no significant AS path changes were observed before and after the anomaly event across the network data available from the collector 'rrc12'. \n\n### Key Findings:\n\n1. **Consistent AS Paths**: Across all reports that identified the anomaly, the observed AS paths before and after the event time remained consistent. Key AS paths included transit through AS1299, AS20940, and others, which did not show any deviations characteristic of typical BGP disruptions like hijacking or leaks.\n\n2. **Lack of Perturbation**: The AS paths to and from key associated AS numbers, such as AS20940 and AS16625, remained unchanged despite the anomaly detection. This indicates an absence of routing changes or unusual activity in the BGP routing tables collected.\n\n3. **Potential False Positive**: The consistency of AS paths reported suggests that the anomaly could be a false positive or triggered by factors outside BGP route path changes. Alternative causes such as transient network issues or data collection errors could be involved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detected anomaly did not manifest in observable changes within the BGP AS paths for the IP prefix 2.16.0.0/13.

Major ASNs involved included AS20940, AS16625, and AS6762.\n\n3. **Anomaly Characterization:**\n   - The detected anomaly appeared not to result from visible AS path deviation, hijacking, or new suspicious routes. Thus, speculation leaned towards transient or localized network instabilities not captured directly within the standard AS path changes.\n   - Potential false positives were highlighted due to a lack of observable path changes, suggesting the detection might stem from changes undetectable through the AS path data provided.\n\n4. **Without Observable Path Changes:**\n   - Reports focused on the unchanging nature of BGP paths as indicative of route stability or possible undetected internal network factors, like configuration changes within AS20940 or network-level operational anomalies.\n\n**Potential Root Causes and Explanations:**\n- **Transient Network Instability:** Momentary issues such as flaps that resolved too quickly to capture in routine AS path updates.\n- **Minor Configuration Changes:** Could have been made within AS routes or propagation policies of involved ASNs without altering the larger path visibility.\n- **Monitoring Noise or Artefacts:** Possible inaccuracies or system noise leading to false alerts in the anomaly detection mechanism.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive and persistent monitoring around 2.16.0.0/13 and associated ASNs (20940, 6762, 16625) to capture any transient changes not visible in snapshots.\n2. **Coordination with Operators**: Engage with AS operators to cross-check any maintenance activities or internal policy changes correlating with the anomaly timestamp.\n3. **Cross-Verifications**: Utilize additional collector data and cross-regional BGP perspectives for broader visibility of the anomaly's footprint.\n\n### Conclusion\nThough the observable BGP AS path data reflects consistency across this anomaly event, it suggests either an alternative explanation beyond path changes or monitoring artefact flagging. Further steps should include deep dives into transient network conditions and additional data collection to clarify any underlying disturbances impacting the network landscape associated with 2.16.0.0/13.\n\n---\nThis comprehensive summary concludes the analysis of the BGP anomaly detected on May 25, 2023, for the specified IP prefix using available data.

This withdrawal indicates that routes for these prefixes were not available, possibly due to a configuration change or an unplanned outage.\n\n### Key Observations from Reports with Anomalies\n1. **Prefix Withdrawal:**\n   - **Detected by Collector rrc24:**\n     - Pre-event paths to 2.18.160.0/22 included AS 28000, 6057, and 20940.\n     - Post-event paths showed an absence of advertised paths for 2.18.160.0/22, suggesting a route withdrawal or blackout.\n\n2. **Transient Route Anomalies:**\n   - Temporary disruptions in BGP paths indicating potential route flaps but eventually reverting to usual paths.\n   - Anomalous withdrawals were not captured in subsequent path analysis, which shows stable routing paths through AS 20940 before and after the event.\n   \n3. **False Positives in Detection:**\n   - Other reports did not reveal AS path changes for the specified prefix, leading to potential false positives. They emphasize the need to recalibrate anomaly detection mechanisms due to no evident BGP path changes.\n   \n### Conclusion\nThe anomaly primarily manifests as a prefix withdrawal for certain sub-prefixes under 2.16.0.0/13, impacting network reachability for affected addresses. While some reports questioned the presence of an anomaly due to stable path observations, the withdrawal of routes from the routing table for targeted sub-prefixes at specific times supports the occurrence of a route withdrawal anomaly.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Network Configuration Review:**\n  Verify and adjust configurations to avoid unintended prefix withdrawals.\n  \n- **Enhanced Monitoring and Detection:**\n  Improve anomaly detection systems with more granular data, potentially incorporating real-time monitoring for short-lived anomalies and high false positive rates.\n  \n- **Engagement with Affected AS Numbers:**\n  Coordinate with involved ASs, especially AS 20940, for insights or changes around the event timeline to understand the anomaly's root causes systematically.\n  \n- **Data Expansion:**\n  Utilize additional data sources from more collectors and integrate external network performance metrics to understand the broader impact of the event.\n\n### Additional Insights\nTo gain full visibility and precise root cause analysis, acquiring more contextual data such as router logs, traffic analytics, and temporal network conditions beyond just BGP path data, would be advantageous.

The routes remained stable as [200454 -> 6939 -> 4826 -> 20940] across all periods observed. This lack of variation suggests that a significant BGP path change, such as route hijacking or AS path rotation, did not occur from the data collected. It is possible that the anomaly may result from transient network issues or a monitoring error.\n\n#### Recommendations for Further Investigation\n1. **Traffic Analysis:** Conduct traffic and service performance analysis to detect any hiccups like latency, packet loss, or overall connectivity issues at the service level during the event period.\n2. **Cross-Verification:** Verify anomaly indications with other BGP collectors to determine if alternative routes or network anomalies were observed from different vantage points.\n3. **Network State Examination:** Look for any operational changes or incident reports from participating ASes (200454, 6939, 4826, 20940) to discover undetected activities or maintenance action around the anomaly timeframe.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe provided data does not support the presence of any BGP routing anomalies through detected AS path deviations for the prefix 2.16.0.0/13. A more detailed network examination through diverse data metrics beyond BGP, such as network performance logs or direct network tests, is recommended to conclude the scope and nature of the reported anomaly accurately.\n\nThis report serves to consolidate findings from various sources, signifying a potential data misinterpretation or transient effect not captured by BGP path changes alone.", "**BGP Anomaly Summary Report for IP Prefix 2.16.0.0/13**\n\n**Event Details:**\n- **Event Detection Time:** 2023-05-25 11:21:40\n- **IP Prefix:** 2.16.0.0/13\n- **Collectors Indicating Anomalies:** Various collectors reviewed, only significant potential anomaly observed with collector rrc25\n\n**Anomaly Description:**\n- **Type of Anomaly:** Route Flapping Indication\n- **Key AS Paths Involved:**\n  - Before/After Event paths consistent but noted potential rapid updates (flapping) involving AS paths featuring `AS6939` and its interaction with peer `AS20940`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **AS Path Consistency:** Most collectors and reports indicated consistent AS paths with historical records, such as paths that include AS numbers like `6939, 4826, 20940`. However, only the report from collector rrc25 suggested a potential anomaly that might be indicative of transient changes or flapping not captured over consistent snapshots.\n  \n- **Route Flapping Suspicion:** Although no permanent routes changes were recorded, the possibility of rapid, temporary path changes contributing to perceived instability was flagged by one report, suggesting a route flapping scenario possibly involving `AS6939`.\n\n- **Additional Required Data for Confirmation:** \n  - More granular BGP updates or logs to capture these transient changes.\n  - Data from a broader set of collectors to support or refute the observed flapping.\n  - Confirmation of network operator logs or alerts indicating such transient conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe majority of reports concluded with no detected anomaly, reflecting stable, consistent AS paths pre- and post-event. However, one report from a specific collector indicated potential evidence of a transient routing anomaly not evident in typical AS path changes, likely due to route flapping involving `AS6939`. This underscores the need for a wider net of diagnostic data and suggests a transient but not persisting event since no long-term deviation from normal path behavior was detected.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Increase Monitoring Frequency:** To better capture transient anomalies, increase the temporal frequency of BGP data collection.\n2. **Cross-Verify with Traffic Data:** Review traffic patterns and connectivity reports for further indications of disruptions.\n3. **Engage with Network Operators:** Communication with operators of involved AS numbers for corroborating evidence or changes during the timeframe.\n4. **Implement Anomaly Validation Measures:** Establish baseline metrics for path flapping to distinguish genuine anomalies from transient or routine network activity.\n\nThe findings suggest a largely stable routing environment for the specified prefix but highlight the importance of continuous and multi-faceted monitoring approaches to capture fleeting network anomalies effectively.", "### BGP Anomaly Event Report\n\n**Event Date and Time:** May 25, 2023, 11:21:40 UTC\n\n**Affected IP Prefix:** 2.16.0.0/13\n\n**Data Sources:** Various BGP collectors and peers.\n\n**Type of Anomaly:** Path Stability and Reachability Anomaly\n\n#### Summary:\n\nOn May 25, 2023, at approximately 11:21:40, an anomaly related to the BGP routing paths towards the IP prefix 2.16.0.0/13 was detected.
