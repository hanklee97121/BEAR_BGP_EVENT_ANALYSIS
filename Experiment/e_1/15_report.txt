"### BGP Anomaly Report\n\n#### Date and Time\n- **Event Detected:** April 16, 2021\n- **Time:** 13:48:00\n\n#### Target IP Prefix\n- **IP Prefix:** 5.35.230.0/24\n\n#### Anomaly Type\n- **Type:** BGP Hijacking or Leak\n\n#### Analysis Overview\n\nAn analysis of AS paths before and after the anomaly event, observed through various collectors, indicates a significant change in the routes to the IP prefix 5.35.230.0/24. This change suggests a possible BGP hijack or leak event.\n\n#### Detailed Findings\n\n1. **Unusual AS Paths:**\n   - In the data collected after the event, an anomalous AS path was identified: '2386', '68956', '26125', '53062', '9124'. \n   - Multiple routes that ended with AS paths containing segments like '87490', '26125', '53062', and '9124' were observed (e.g., from collectors rrc00, rrc05, rrc06, etc.). These segments were not present in the paths prior to the incident.\n\n2. **Empty AS Paths:**\n   - Post-event data from rrc00 and rrc11 show empty AS paths for certain routes, e.g., paths for peers '14218', '42929', '22897', and '49697', which may suggest a withdrawal or disruption in usual routing paths.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - Before the event, typical AS paths heavily featured stable segments like '17467'. However, after the anomaly, the regular appearance of '53062' and '9124' marks a stark deviation, not observed in historical paths.\n   - From collector rrc10, interleaved segments like '97198', '1109', '17467' continued normally while certain paths diverted. This indicates selective hijacking or leaking rather than a broad disruption.\n\n4. **Historical Context:**\n   - In historical data, paths containing '53062' or '9124' in relation to 5.35.230.0/24 are not observed, further suggesting the integrity of routing for this prefix is compromised during the event.\n\n#### Affected AS Numbers and IP Addresses\n- **Primary Affected AS:** AS 5.35.230.0/24\n- **Anomalous AS Paths:** The routes involving '53062', '9124', and their preceding ASes (e.g., '26125') are significant for investigation.\n  \n#### Conclusion\nThe incident most likely represents a BGP hijacking or leak, given the sudden appearance of unusual AS paths and empty/null routes from identified collectors. The presence of the anomalous AS path '53062', '9124' across multiple collectors underscores the potential manipulation or error in routing information dissemination.\n\n#### Recommendations\n- **Monitoring:** Increase the monitoring of routes to 5.35.230.0/24 for further unusual AS paths.\n- **Coordination:** Communicate with ASes in the path '53062', '9124' to verify legitimate announcements.\n- **Prevention:** Implement strict filtering rules and enhance validation measures like deploying BGPsec or RPKI to prevent similar future incidents.\n\n#### Missing Data Note\nThe data provides sufficient evidence to identify an anomaly in BGP routing. However, real-time control messages or announcements from BGP security mechanisms could offer additional verification on whether these announcements were intended or part of a hijack scenario."
