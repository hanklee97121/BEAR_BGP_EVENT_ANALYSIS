During the time of interest, one specific Autonomous System (AS), **AS70644**, along with **AS62038**, emerged in multiple AS paths where they were previously not present before the event. This suggests the possibility of a route hijack, where an unauthorized AS is mistakenly announcing routes to make traffic pass through them.\n\n#### Anomaly Details:\n1. **Update Involving AS70644 and AS62038:**\n   - After the event, multiple routes seen through different collectors started displaying AS70644 and AS62038 in their paths, e.g., paths including ['3085', '70644', '62038'].\n   - These changes impacted several peers from different collectors such as `rrc00`, `rrc01`, `rrc03`, `rrc11`, `rrc13`, and others.\n\n2. **Comparison with Historical Data:**\n   - Prior to the event, AS70644 and AS62038 were not observed in paths to 104.244.42.0/24, and typically paths terminated at AS72310.\n   - Historically, paths to the prefix included stable paths such as through `AS87085`, `AS75192`, and `AS15612`. The emergence of AS70644 and AS62038 constitutes an anomaly.\n\n3. **Impacted Prefixes:**\n   - The anomaly mainly impacted the prefix 104.244.42.0/24, as reflected in most of the discussed AS paths.\n\n4. **AS Involvement and Changes**:\n   - Collectors providing updated paths indicated that several AS paths were altered. AS such as `AS10587`, previously reaching 72310, showed different paths involving AS70644 or AS62038.\n\n5. **Potential Routing Issue**: \n   - The presence of AS70644 and AS62038 in the paths could be indicative of a possible BGP misconfiguration or an intentional traffic routing manipulation.\n\n#### Further Information Required:\n- Data indicating legitimate AS relationships between AS70644, AS62038, and the original ASes to assess if this change was scheduled or permissible. \n- Detailed announcement logs of AS70644 and AS62038 during the event window to determine the intended propagation of their routes.\n- Network operator feedback to validate if this appearance was planned or an unexpected behavior.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe observed BGP anomaly involving IP prefix 104.244.42.0/24 appears to stem from unexpected AS path changes indicating potential route hijacking or misconfiguration introduced by AS70644 and AS62038. Verification with network operators and a deeper understanding of their routing intentions during the event are advisable to mitigate potential unauthorized traffic routing.\n\n---"
