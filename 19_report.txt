"# BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 101.101.101.0/24\n\n**Date and Time of Detection:**\n- **Event Start:** 2019-05-08 15:08:00\n\n**IP Prefix Affected:**\n- IP Prefix: 101.101.101.0/24\n\n**Anomaly Type:**\n- **Route Hijacking:** There is a strong indication of route hijacking, as an unexpected Autonomous System (AS) path to the IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24 appears after the anomaly onset.\n\n**Details of the Anomaly:**\n- **Unexpected AS Paths Observed:**\n  - Many paths to the IP prefix now include AS `40025`, AS `20640`, and AS `75191`, which were not present in the historical or preceding data.\n  - These AS numbers appear consistently in the paths from multiple collectors, indicating that they are new entries for reaching the affected IP prefix. This consistent pattern suggests a BGP hijacking event where paths have been erroneously or maliciously diverted through these AS numbers.\n\n- **Affected Networks:**\n  - Numerous networks, including those with historical paths through AS `26130`, AS `48047`, and AS `55947` have been rerouted through the AS path ending in AS `40025`, AS `20640`, and AS `75191`.\n  \n- **Historical AS Path Comparison:**\n  - Before the anomaly, the extensive paths did not show any instance of AS `40025`, AS `20640`, or AS `75191` related to the IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24.\n  - The presence of established AS numbers such as `26130`, `48047`, and `55947` demonstrates the typical path observed historically towards the IP prefix.\n\n**Related Autonomous Systems:**\n- New, anomalous AS path components include:\n  - **AS 40025**\n  - **AS 20640**\n  - **AS 75191**\n\n**Impact on Network Routing:**\n- The introduction of AS paths through AS `40025`, AS `20640`, and AS `75191` may cause traffic intended for the IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24 to be redirected, potentially leading to misrouting, data interception or other forms of traffic disruption.\n- Route instability or routing inefficiencies are likely outcomes, as typical paths diverge into unfamiliar AS realms.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n- **Verify AS Announcements:** Contact the network administrator of AS `26130`, AS `48047`, and AS `55947` to confirm whether the anomaly paths detected match their expected BGP announcements.\n- **Investigate Malicious Activity:** Engage with the involved AS numbers\u2014AS `40025`, AS `20640`, and AS `75191`\u2014to determine if the route changes are due to a configuration error, unauthorized configuration change, or potential malicious activity.\n- **Implement Filters:** Consider applying BGP filters for AS paths that are inconsistent with known, legitimate routing policies to prevent acceptance of illegitimate routes.\n\n**Additional Data Needed (if applicable):**\n- Given the clarity of the AS paths before and after the anomaly, sufficient historical and comparative data is provided to identify this hijacking incident. No further data is requested for anomaly verification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24 experienced a BGP anomaly consistent with a route hijacking event on 2019-05-08. Prompt action is recommended to mitigate potential network risks and restore legitimate routing paths."
