"### Report on BGP Anomaly Event for IP Prefix 99.225.224.0/19\n\n#### Time of Event:\n- **Start Time:** 2020-07-30 01:15:38\n\n#### Anomaly Type:\n- **BGP Withdrawal/Route Hijacking:**\n\n#### Description:\nDuring the examination of AS paths before and after the detected anomaly event towards the IP prefix 99.225.224.0/19, there was a significant change observed. The majority of routes leading to this prefix were withdrawn during the event. This suggests an event typical of BGP withdrawal or possibly a route hijacking where legitimate paths are removed or replaced.\n\n#### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Route Withdrawal:**\n   - A significant number of AS paths to the sub-prefix 99.225.224.0/19 were withdrawn post-event across multiple collectors such as `rrc00`, `rrc01`, `rrc03`, etc.\n   - Prior to the event, paths existed to the 99.225.224.0/19 prefix from numerous peers which were subsequently removed. Examples include AS paths from peers like `20205`, `6908`, `15169`, and additional, which were no longer present after the event.\n\n2. **Decreased Visibility:**\n   - The decreased visibility could imply either BGP session flapping, aggressive filtering policies, deliberate anomalies, or even a hijacking attempt occurring at or just before the event timeline.\n\n3. **New AS Paths:**\n   - New, unfamiliar AS paths appear leading to the same prefix post-event, indicating possible route hijacking. AS `7219` leading to `10990` appears in several paths not previously recorded, making the presence of these routes suspicious.\n\n#### Related AS Numbers:\n- **AS10990 / AS7219:** \n  - The appearance of these AS numbers in new paths post-anomaly is not found in previous routings in history or before the event, which warrants further scrutiny into their legitimacy.\n\n#### IP Address Involved:\n- **99.225.224.0/19:**\n  - Directly affected with significant route withdrawals and changes in AS path.\n\n#### Suggested Further Investigation:\n- **Route Hijacking Verification:**\n  - Determine if AS10990 and/or AS7219 are legitimate ASes authorized to announce 99.225.224.0/19.\n- **Communicate with AS10990 and AS7219:**\n  - Verify whether there was an intended announcement of the prefix or check for potential misconfigurations or malice.\n  \n#### Conclusion:\nThe anomaly event for 99.225.224.0/19 appears critical due to the severe withdrawal of paths and emergence of potentially unauthorized AS paths. It's crucial to discern if a genuine network operation change occurred or if this falls under malicious BGP route hijacking. Immediate engagement with network administrators of the involved AS numbers and thorough verification of routing policies is advised.\n\n#### Note:\n- **Missing Data:** The data is largely sufficient, but real-time monitoring data or specific logs detailing configuration changes during or shortly before the anomaly might help in understanding the nature of these AS path changes more comprehensively."
