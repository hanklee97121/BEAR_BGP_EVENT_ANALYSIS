"## BGP Anomaly Report\n\n### Event Overview\n\n**IP Prefix Affected:** 201.157.49.0/24  \n**Event Start Time:** 2021-02-11 04:36:41 UTC  \n**Collectors Involved:** rrc00, rrc01, rrc03, rrc04, rrc05, rrc06, rrc07, rrc10, rrc11, rrc12, rrc13, rrc14, rrc15, rrc16, rrc18, rrc19, rrc20, rrc21, rrc22, rrc23, rrc24  \n**Anomaly Type:** Potential Hijack or Misconfiguration  \n**Related AS Numbers:** 68510, 86364, 41379  \n**Impacted IP Address:** 201.157.49.0/24  \n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### Baseline Routing Behavior (Before the Event)\n\n1. **Historical and Pre-event Observation:**\n   - The IP prefix 201.157.49.0/24 was not independently visible in the routing tables prior to the anomaly. Only the aggregate prefix 201.157.0.0/17 was consistently advertised.\n   - AS paths leading to 201.157.0.0/17 consistently ended at AS 44816, which is the expected origin for the aggregate prefix.\n\n#### Anomalous Behavior (During the Event)\n\n1. **AS Paths Post-Event:**\n   - The prefix 201.157.49.0/24 became independently visible.\n   - New AS paths included AS numbers 68510, 86364, and 41379.\n   - The presence of AS 68510, 86364, and 41379 suggests a potential subprefix hijack or a deliberate and unauthorized advertisement of deeper prefix granularity.\n\n2. **Visibility Across Collectors:**\n   - Multiple collectors (rrc00, rrc01, rrc03, rrc05, rrc12, rrc15, rrc21, rrc23, rrc24) reported paths pointing directly to 201.157.49.0/24 which was not observed before the event.\n   - The sudden appearance of these new paths shows signs of a potential routing anomaly, which aligns with hijacking or misconfiguration events.\n\n#### Post-Event Analysis\n\n1. **Impact Assessment:**\n   - The prefix under AS path including AS 68510, 86364, and 41379 suggests unauthorized routing changes.\n   - This could have resulted in traffic intended for the original AS 44816 to be misdirected or intercepted by the networks associated with AS 68510, 86364, and 41379.\n\n2. **Operational Concerns:**\n   - This incident may have disrupted services or user connectivity linked to 201.157.49.0/24, given its deviation from the usual AS 44816 origin.\n   - Immediate resolution would be needed to prevent service disruptions and potential security breaches.\n\n### Missing Data and Recommendations\n\n- **Confirmation of Ownership:** The legitimate ownership of 201.157.49.0/24 must be verified to discern the authenticity of advertised AS paths involving ASes 68510, 86364, and 41379.\n- **Further Data Collection:** Gathering additional BGP data beyond the scope of the current collectors might provide more insights into the anomaly's full impact.\n- **AS Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement BGP monitoring tools to detect similar anomalies in the future to mitigate risks associated with potential routing attacks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe anomalous routing event observed on 201.157.49.0/24 raises concerns of a BGP hijack or misconfiguration involving AS 68510, 86364, and 41379. Swift verification and remediation of this anomaly are advised to restore expected network behavior and ensure the security and stability of routing for the affected IP prefix. Additional vigilance is recommended through further monitoring and alerting mechanisms."
