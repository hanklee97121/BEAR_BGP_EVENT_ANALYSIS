"### BGP Network Anomaly Report\n\n**Event Details**\n- **Target IP Prefix**: 205.251.192.0/23\n- **Event Start Time**: 2018-04-24 11:05:00\n\n**Findings**\n\n1. **Anomaly Type**: BGP Hijacking or Sub-prefix Hijacking\n\n2. **Affected IP Prefixes**: 205.251.192.0/23, with additional attention to sub-prefixes 205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24 which were newly introduced.\n\n3. **Related AS Numbers**: \n   - **AS51929**: This AS number appeared in the paths to the newly introduced sub-prefixes (205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24) after the anomaly event. Specifically, paths like `['98965', '68924', '44090', '38999', '51929']` were noticed.\n   - **AS38999**: This AS is seen in the paths towards the new sub-prefixes after the event and was not present in historical paths for the main prefix.\n\n4. **Anomaly Description**:\n   - Anomalies were detected as the IP sub-prefixes 205.251.192.0/24 and 205.251.193.0/24 appeared in the routing tables post-event. In normal circumstances, ISPs and ASes advertise only their assigned IP prefixes or the ones of their customers. Introducing sub-prefixes in the network like this highly suggests a hijacking attempt.\n   - These sub-prefixes were propagated through paths including AS51929 and AS38999, which were not seen in historical and before-event data paths for 205.251.192.0/23.\n\n5. **Path Changes**:\n   - Before the event, the AS paths to 205.251.192.0/23 did not change significantly compared to historical data. \n   - After the event, new AS paths included sub-prefixes, indicating that they were now being announced and propagated across multiple collectors.\n   \n**Conclusion**: \n\nThe anomaly event seems consistent with a BGP hijacking event involving unauthorized announcement of sub-prefixes. The presence of previously unseen AS numbers (AS51929 and AS38999) in the paths to these sub-prefixes suggests their potential involvement in the anomaly.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n\n1. **Contact Network Operators**: Reach out to the operators of AS51929 and AS38999 for verifying the authenticity of these routes.\n2. **Review BGP Filters**: Implement and review export policies for preventing acceptance of sub-prefixes not explicitly expected.\n3. **Collaborate with Monitoring Services**: Use services that can automatically alert for unexpected sub-prefix announcements and assist in rapid response.\n4. **Coordinate with Affected Parties**: Notify the owners of 205.251.192.0/23 about the anomaly for their internal review and response. \n\n**Missing Data**:\n- Detailed logs or information about policy changes at AS51929 and AS38999 that might explain the change in routing behavior.\n- Further historic BGP data to corroborate which AS initially introduced the sub-prefix paths post-event."
