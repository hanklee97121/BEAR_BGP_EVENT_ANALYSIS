"**BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 101.101.101.0/24**\n\n---\n\n**Event Overview:**\n\n- **Target IP Prefix:** 101.101.101.0/24\n- **Date and Time of Event Start:** 2019-05-08 15:08:00\n- **Type of Anomaly Detected:** BGP Hijack or Misconfiguration \n- **Key ASes Involved:** AS268869, AS4230 (Highly Suspected Originators post-event)\n- **Related IP Addresses/Sub-Prefixes:** 101.101.101.0/24 is the primary affected prefix.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n**1. Historical BGP Routing (Baseline):**\n\nExamining the historical AS paths for IP prefix 101.101.101.0/24, we observed consistent path patterns primarily ending with the sequence leading to AS3462 and AS131621. This appears to be the legitimate route for this prefix. The AS path variations often include AS6453, AS29222, AS3257, AS1299, AS6762, and AS3356, among others. Throughout history, AS131621 seems to be the origin AS for this prefix.\n\n**2. AS Paths Before the Anomaly:**\n\nBefore the anomaly event, the AS paths were stable, with commonly seen originating ASes like AS3462 and AS131621, along with common transit ASes such as AS6453, AS3356, and AS2914. There are no major deviations or unexpected origin ASes reported before the incident.\n\n**3. AS Paths After the Anomaly:**\n\nPost-event examination shows significant changes in AS paths. A new, unexpected AS appears in many paths: AS268869 and AS4230 now prominently appear in the path where they didn't before. The AS paths also reflect large portions redirecting through AS2828. These changes suggest a potential prefix hijack or misconfiguration event, with AS268869 appearing as the new, incorrect origin for multiple collectors.\n\n**4. Specific Path Changes:**\n\n- Collector `rrc00`: Notable changes include paths like ['174', '2828', '4230', '268869'] and ['61218', '35619', '41108', '174', '2828', '4230', '268869'] post-event.\n- Collector `rrc01` sees AS '8607' preceding AS2828 and AS4230, which are new and incorrect paths for this prefix.\n- Collectors such as `rrc04`, `rrc10`, and `rrc12` show AS paths like ['553', '3356', '2828', '4230', '268869'], reflecting an unnecessary and incorrect detour.\n  \n**5. Missing Data and Analysis Upon Comparison With Historical Records:**\n\nThe post-event AS paths suggest that the prefix may have been hijacked or misconfigured to propagate through AS268869, which is anomalous given historical and pre-event path data. However, the exact intent (malicious hijack versus accidental misconfiguration) requires additional investigation like policy changes, or real-time announcements which are not present in this dataset.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nThis BGP event reflects the behavior seen in a BGP prefix hijack or an unintentional misconfiguration event. The suspicious involvement of AS268869 indicates this AS could have improperly advertised the prefix, perhaps due to misconfiguration or an attack, redirecting traffic away from intended routes. Immediate steps should include contacting AS268869 for any announcements and verifying the legitimacy and intended purposes of those BGP advertisements. Coordination with RIRs (Regional Internet Registries) may also be necessary to prevent the repeat occurrence of such events. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- **Mitigation and Response:** Collaborate with AS268869 to resolve the anomaly.\n- **Preventive Measures:** Enhance prefix filtering and monitoring practices to prevent similar incidents.\n- **Further Investigation:** Confirm if AS268869 intentionally or mistakenly propagated these paths and assess potential impacts.\n\n---\n\n**End of Report**"
