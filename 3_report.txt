"## Network Anomaly Report\n\n### Event Overview\n- **IP Prefix Detected**: 211.249.216.0/21\n- **Anomaly Detection Time**: 2022-02-03 01:04:00 UTC\n\n### Anomaly Type\nThe anomaly detected in this event can be identified as a **Sub-prefix Hijacking** or **Erroneous Deaggregation**.\n\n### Affected Sub-prefix\n- **Sub-prefix Introduced**: 211.249.221.0/24\n\n### Impacted Autonomous Systems (AS)\nA number of Autonomous Systems (ASes) were affected by this anomaly, with several AS paths disappearing after the event for the sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24. Prior to the anomaly, this sub-prefix was not advertised separately from its parent prefix (211.249.216.0/21).\n\n### Key Observations\n1. **New Sub-prefix**: The introduction of the sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24 was observed after the anomaly event. This sub-prefix is not present in the historical and pre-event data for any of the collectors or peers.\n   \n2. **Disappearance of Announcement for New Sub-prefix**:\n   - Many AS paths to the newly announced sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24 show empty or null paths, indicating withdrawals or non-recognition after the event.\n   - Examples of AS paths with no subsequent announcements include:\n     - Collector 'rrc00': Various AS paths (e.g., 7018, 49134, 44103) were noted to report an empty path to sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24.\n     - Collector 'rrc01': ASes such as 6908, 24482, 1299, and others report no path to the new sub-prefix.\n     - Similar patterns can be seen across multiple collectors for 211.249.221.0/24.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis with Historical Data**:\n   - In the historical data for 211.249.216.0/21 and its sub-prefixes, no sub-prefix advertisement of 211.249.221.0/24 was previously observed.\n   - Paths to the main prefix (211.249.216.0/21) remained consistent with historical records, except for the new sub-prefix event.\n\n### Related AS Numbers and Impact\n- **Significant Withdrawals/Non-announcements**: Multiple AS numbers across different collectors showed disappearance of announcements. This indicates the event potentially impacted connectivity to the sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24.\n   - AS numbers impacted include 7018, 49134, 29075, etc., as observed with select collectors.\n  \n### Conclusions and Recommendations\nThis event appears to be a result of a specific network misconfiguration or policy change leading to a suspicious de-aggregation of the prefix 211.249.216.0/21. The introduction of the new sub-prefix 211.249.221.0/24, which resulted in ephemeral routing announcements that were subsequently withdrawn or not visible, underscores the need for:\n1. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement continuous monitoring and timely alerting systems for new sub-prefix announcements that are not part of the expected IP address space management.\n2. **Routing Policy Review**: Engage in a comprehensive review of routing policies across affected ASes to prevent incorrect de-aggregation or hijacking attempts.\n3. **Validation and Verification Protocols**: Encourage the deployment of route validation mechanisms like RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) to authenticate announcements and trace possible route leaks or hijacks.\n  \nIf preventative and corrective measures are not already in place, it is highly suggested to enforce policies and systems to prevent future occurrences of similar anomalies, thereby maintaining stable and secure internet routing."
