"## BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 46.145.0.0/16\n\n**Event Identification**\n\n- **Target IP Prefix**: 46.145.0.0/16\n- **Date and Time of Anomaly Detection**: 2019-06-06 09:57:00 UTC\n- **Anomaly Type**: Path Hijacking or Route Leak\n- **Related AS Number**: 4134\n- **Key Affected Sub-prefix**: 46.145.0.0/16\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis report outlines the analysis and findings related to an observed BGP anomaly affecting the IP prefix 46.145.0.0/16 beginning on June 6, 2019, at 09:57:00 UTC. The primary signatures indicate a potential path hijacking or route leak involving AS 4134, a major tier-1 provider (China Telecom).\n\n**Detailed Analysis**\n\n### Historical Paths\nThe historical paths for 46.145.0.0/16 were relatively stable, predominantly leading to AS 1136, which appears to be the originating AS for the prefix. Historical paths prior to the event did not demonstrate routing through AS 4134.\n\n### Paths Before the Event\nBefore the anomaly, routing paths directed traffic through typical upstream providers such as AS 1136, AS 15605, AS 50304, among others, without any significant deviations or new occurrences of AS 4134 in paths directed to the prefix 46.145.0.0/16.\n\n### Paths After the Event\nPost-anomaly inspection of paths shows a significant change:\n\n- **AS 4134** is newly inserted in numerous paths across multiple collectors. An unexpected routing path involving AS 4134 observed as: \n  - Many AS paths transitioned from the historical final AS 1136 to an altered path inclusive of AS 4134 (for example, paths such as ['4134', '21217', '13237', '1136']).\n  \nThis rapid and widespread introduction of AS 4134 implies manipulation of existing BGP routes to propagate an altered path sequence, which could either be due to a configuration error (route leak) or a deliberate path hijack.\n\n**Potential Impact**\n- **Traffic Redirection**: Any traffic targeted at 46.145.0.0/16 could potentially have been redirected through AS 4134. This change could lead to increased latency, interception, or data manipulation.\n- **Security Concerns**: The involvement of AS 4134, a Chinese telecom giant, in the path is particularly concerning given past incidents of similar nature.\n\n**Conclusion and Recommendations**\n\nGiven these observations, the following actions are recommended:\n1. **Coordination with Upstream Providers**: Immediate communication with relevant AS peers and possibly the originating AS (AS 1136) to verify configurations and ensure routes are restored to intended paths.\n   \n2. **BGP Monitoring Enhancement**: Implement tools or services for dynamic BGP monitoring and alerting to timely detect similar anomalies.\n\n3. **Investigation of AS 4134's Role**: Detailed investigation and response may be warranted regarding AS 4134's involvement during the anomaly window, potentially through direct communication or verification with AS 4134 routing authorities.\n\nThe anomaly suggests a probable route hijack or leak incident significantly altering BGP path behavior involving AS 4134. Timely mitigation strategies and further investigation into the root cause and implications are crucial."
