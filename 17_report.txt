"**BGP Anomaly Report for IP Prefix 99.225.224.0/19**\n\n**Event Overview**\n\n- **IP Prefix Involved:** 99.225.224.0/19 (sub-prefixes of 99.225.192.0/18)\n- **Event Detection Time:** 2020-07-30 01:15:38\n- **Collectors Affected:** Multiple collectors observed anomalies, specifically significant alterations in the AS paths to the affected prefix and its sub-prefixes.\n  \n**Anomaly Details**\n\n1. **Anomaly Type: Route Withdrawal or Disappearance**\n   - An unexpected path nullification is observed for 99.225.224.0/19 from several BGP collectors, indicating that the prefix became unreachable from certain peers. This suggests route withdrawal or suppression likely due to either configuration issues, policy changes, or potential upstream failures.\n     \n2. **Affected ASNs and Patterns:**\n   - Multiple ASNs previously providing routes to the prefix, including ASs like 27504, 87642, 8324, and others, show blank or missing paths post-event.\n   - ASNs such as 58938, 68956, and 46233 were seen in common paths previously but saw their path information either entirely withdrawn or altered significantly.\n   - New paths seen involve AS87706 with various transitional ASNs, suggesting potential path hijacks or redistributions that impacted legitimate path visibility for the affected prefix.\n\n3. **Transition Observations Post-Event:**\n   - Preceding the event, paths were stable across multiple collector outputs with continuous visibility.\n   - The affected prefix 99.225.224.0/19 experienced a common set of AS paths arriving to it, which largely disappeared across collectors post-event.\n   - The reappearance of paths including AS87706 with its downstream AS65632, AS62180 visible in sporadically altered paths, showcases a quick, albeit irregular recovery, which is not uniform across collectors.\n\n**Required Missing Data for Full Analysis:**\n\n- Longitudinal trace or log of configuration changes or BGP UPDATE messages from key ASes involved, particularly those acting as upstream for prefix 99.225.192.0/18 with sub-prefix changes to 99.225.224.0/19.\n- Verification of routing policies, especially from AS64102 and AS7018, which displayed significant absence in path changes in the latter stage, to confirm intentional routing or policy changes. \n- Detailed peering logs for AS62180 and AS87706 to discern if they took precedence in the routing or if this was an artifact of altered policy configurations or unintended path selections.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe event on 2020-07-30 led to significant path disappearance for the prefix 99.225.224.0/19, suggestive of a route withdrawal or systemic suppression across multiple networks. The reappearance of alternative paths involving first-time upstream AS87706 against absent recurrent paths reinforces the potential misconfiguration or unintended withdrawal as a cause, potentially initiated by malicious path alterations or configuration mistakes. Further verification of route policies and an analysis of event correlating messages can help in deciphering the underlying causes and preempt future occurrences."
